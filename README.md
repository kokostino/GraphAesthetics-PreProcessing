  Due to the permutation invariance of dominant image colours, the respective colour information is translated to colour names and one-hot-encoded.
  The colour to name mapping was taken from xkcd [here](https://xkcd.com/color/rgb/) and [here](https://xkcd.com/color/satfaces.txt) and from the
  [webcolors package](https://github.com/ubernostrum/webcolors).
